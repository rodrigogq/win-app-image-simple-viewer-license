Simple said: 

I DO NOT COLLECT, STORE OR TRANSMIT ANY PERSONAL DATA WITH THIS APP. PERIOD.

The goal of this app is for you to open images in your computer without the hassle of a multitute of ugly controls on the screen used for editing images. By this means, Microsoft requires me to declare that I need access to the file system, but that does not mean I am going to use this to track your files or something (most windows apps have this permission and you might not be aware of that).

Please do not send any inquiries about this app. If you do not feel confortable with this app, please uninstall it.
